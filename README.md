# Description:

Encyclopedia Mettalium Reincarnated is a modern adaptation of the original Encyclopedia Mettalium, designed to optimize its features, use more reliable APIs, and provide cleaner syntax. The project uses Python's Flask library for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, alongside Bootstrap and Jinja2 templates.

## Key features include:

- **Artist Search**: Users can search for any artist available on Spotify.

- **Artist Information:** Displays the artist’s image, genres, Spotify URL, and follower count.

- **Album Information:** Lists all albums for each artist, along with track names and release dates.

- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages errors such as API timeouts or invalid searches to ensure a smooth user experience.

- **Responsive Design:** Uses simple HTML and Jinja templates to display results cleanly and readably across devices.

### project purpse
This project was developed as part of an educational exercise to improve skills in Python, Flask, API integration, and web development fundamentals. The knowledge gained here can be applied to more complex web applications involving external data sources, user interaction, and real-time updates.

>On a personal note, I chose this project because, as a member of the alternative music scene, I found the original Encyclopedia Mettalium frustrating to use. The lack of a modern adaptation made it difficult to access band information efficiently, and this project was my way of addressing that problem. 
and I wanted to recreate a great idea which was unfortionatly unattended# encyclopedia_mettalium
